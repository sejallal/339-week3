  <h2>Anxiety Disorder</h2>
  <p>People with this disorder respond to situations or tangible objects with fear, stress or dread. This
    interferes with ones daily functioning and can cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, shaking
    or crying leading to anxiety attacks or fear of social situations. Anxiety Disorder affects over 40 million adults
    over the age of 18; however 1/3 of these people seek treatment. There is a wide variety of reasons why a person
  can experience Anxiety Disorder from genetics to life experiences to stress. </p>

    Irregular heartbeat, Fatigue, Irregular heartbeat, Headache, Upset stomach
  <h3>What you should do if you notice signs of Anxiety Disorder in you or a friend</h3>
  <p>On a college campus, especially as a school as prestigious as the University of Michigan, there are many stress
    factors both expected and unexpected students can experience through academics, extracurriculars or even social
    situations. In order to reduce this in your life, think about finding people you can trust and talk to about how
    you are feeling. Writing down your thoughts in a journal is highly recommended as well. Stress relievers such as
    singing, dancing, reading, etc. can help distract you from that stress or help you express it. Finally, using the
    resources on/off campus as well as many organizations that offer apps and assistance when it comes to anxiety such as
    the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Psychological Association, Anxiety Resource Center,
    and the Social Anxiety Association can help you find ways to cope and improve your or your friend's Anxiety Disorder. </p>
